  <p>Hello I am Marcus Campbell. I am a CIS major at the university of South Carolina. 
    I am from Sumter South Carolina. Below is a list of food I like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pizza</li>
    <li>Subs</li>
    <li>Popcorn</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With my free time, I like to play outside. I also like to ride bikes. I love to play minecraft.
    I enjoy analyzing the patterns of the universe. The universe itself is 
    just the recursion of simply patterns, but what if other universe exist? They too would have their own patterns.
